								<h3> Tanvi Modi <br> Master in Information Design and Visulization at Northeastern University <br><br>
									<i class="testimonial-text">"A project like Hues & Tones made me realise how important it is for a designer to understand a
									developer's perspective - how an organically generated design concept needs to be structured
									and logically placed into a visualization. It was also interesting how I needed to convey my ideas to
									a developer in a very rational manner. I strongly believe that projects like these would bridge the
									gap between the designers and developers, which can help solve problems both creatively, and in
									an orderly fashion. I am so grateful to be part of a talented team of engineers of the AlSkunks Works!"</i>

									developer, I get used to concentrate more on the interpretability of a model and have neglected
									the visual impact of the results most of the time. Hues & Tones gave me the unique perspective
									from a designer. There is a clear understanding of the project scope and what is required for com-

										also I enjoyed
										the happiness of collabration and contribution. Importantly, when I was interviewing and introducing my projects with
										interviewers one of them is my current manager-- a project regarding Machine learning interpretability led by Prof.Nik
										impressed him, because this project I was working on was cutting-edge, innovative rather than boring or 'cliche'
										duplications and it has been in finalist of RISE 2019. In the near futher, it's very likely that I'll introduce these
										skills I learned in AISkunkworks to improve our research work in the progress."</i>

								<h3> Pramod Pai <br> Master in Information Systems at Northeastern University <br><br>
									<i class="testimonial-text">"I first found out about AI Skunkworks on LinkedIn. I had previously been involved in the field of machine learning and
									data science and joining AI Skunkworks seemed like an exciting opportunity at the time. I didn’t know what to expect
									from the group initially. There was a meeting prior to the start of the fall 2020 semester where the detailed structure
									and plan for the group was laid out. There were many sub-groups that the members could choose from, like Model
									Interpretability, Auto-visualization, and Auto-reinforcement learning. I picked Model Interpretability as I had trained
									ML models in the past and this group matched my interest closely. But I was completely unaware of the importance and
									significance of interpretability, especially in the context of Industry, before joining the group. As the semester went
									by, I learned more and more about the different techniques in interpretability, trained models, and applied these
									techniques to the models. Every two weeks there was a meeting that was attended by all the group members who rarely
									missed these meetings. All the members in the model interpretability group were under the mentorship and guidance of
									Abhishek and Kartik. The mentors were excellent in paving the way for research in model interpretability. They answered
									all the questions that the members had and also provided state-of-the-art resources to study with, one of which was a
									book that they themselves had written.
									My journey in AI Skunkworks so far has been exceptional. I am very eager to continue my association with the group and
									continue learning. I’m very thankful to Professor Nik Brown for starting this research group and also to my mentors
									Abhishek and Kartik. I have benefitted greatly from the group in terms of the knowledge I have gained. I’m also proud to
									say that my work at AI Skunkworks has culminated in me getting a Programmer-analyst position at Squark.ai. I hope to
									make complete use of this opportunity.
